                { q: "The 'proximal' in ZPD refers to...", o: ["The proximity of the student to the teacher", "What is close to being mastered by the learner", "The next topic in the syllabus", "The end goal of the course"], a: 1, e: "'Proximal' means 'nearby' or 'next', indicating skills the learner is ready to acquire with help." },
                { q: "Which concept is intrinsically linked to ZPD and acts as the mechanism for learning within it?", o: ["Rote memorization", "Scaffolding", "Independent study", "Summative assessment"], a: 1, e: "Scaffolding is the structured support provided by an MKO (More Knowledgeable Other) that enables a learner to navigate their ZPD." },
                { q: "Who can be considered a 'More Knowledgeable Other' (MKO)?", o: ["Only the certified teacher", "Only a native speaker", "Anyone with more expertise, including peers or technology", "Only a parent or guardian"], a: 2, e: "An MKO is anyone or anything that has a better understanding or a higher ability level, including teachers, advanced peers, or even a well-designed app." },
                { q: "What is the primary goal of instruction within the ZPD?", o: ["To make tasks easier for the student", "To internalize skills, making the student independent", "To ensure the student never makes a mistake", "To accelerate through the curriculum"], a: 1, e: "The ultimate goal is for the learner to internalize the guided process, turning what was once achievable with help into an independent skill." },

                { q: "Vygotsky's theory is a form of...", o: ["Behaviorism", "Cognitivism", "Social constructivism", "Humanism"], a: 2, e: "Social constructivism posits that knowledge is constructed through social interaction." },
                { q: "The ZPD is best understood as a concept that is...", o: ["Static and measurable", "Fixed for each age group", "Dynamic and constantly changing", "Irrelevant to adult learners"], a: 2, e: "As a learner acquires new skills, their ZPD shifts. It is a dynamic, not static, concept." },
                { q: "The lower limit of the ZPD represents...", o: ["What a learner can do with assistance", "The learner's potential development", "What a learner can do independently", "The instructional goal"], a: 2, e: "The lower limit is defined by the skills that the student has already mastered and can perform without any help." },
                { q: "The upper limit of the ZPD represents...", o: ["Tasks that are impossible for the learner", "What the learner can achieve with guidance", "Skills the learner has already mastered", "The starting point of instruction"], a: 1, e: "The upper limit is the most a learner can achieve at that moment, but only with the help of an MKO." },

                { q: "The concept of ZPD challenges the sole reliance on...", o: ["Formative assessment", "Collaborative projects", "Standardized, independent testing", "Peer tutoring"], a: 2, e: "Standardized tests only measure what a student can do alone, ignoring their potential for growth with assistance." },
                { q: "Scaffolding, as a teaching strategy, should be...", o: ["Permanent and consistent", "The same for all students", "Temporary and gradually removed", "Used only for difficult subjects"], a: 2, e: "The goal of scaffolding is to provide support only when needed and then fade it away as the learner becomes more competent." },
                { q: "Which of the following is a classic example of scaffolding?", o: ["Letting the student struggle alone", "Giving the student the correct answer immediately", "Breaking a complex task into smaller, manageable steps", "Assigning extra homework"], a: 2, e: "Breaking down a task is a key scaffolding technique to make complex skills more accessible." },
